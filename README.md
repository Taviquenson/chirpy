# üê¶ Chirpy ‚Äî A Mini Twitter Clone Built in Go

**Chirpy** is a lightweight, local-first Twitter-style API server written in Go.  
It allows users to **create accounts, log in, post "chirps" (short messages of up to 140 characters)**, and manage their data‚Äîall backed by a **PostgreSQL** database.

If you‚Äôre learning how to build a production-style backend with Go or want a simple microservice to test authentication, database interactions, and RESTful API design, Chirpy is a perfect starting point.
