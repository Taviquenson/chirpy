This command contains the connection string for the database:
psql "postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/chirpy"

To migrate the database up/down using goose, navigate to sql/schema folder and use command:
goose postgres "postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/chirpy" up


Remember you need to add Google's uuid package manually by running:
go get github.com/google/uuid
As well as a Postgres driver! So program knows how to talk to the database:
go get github.com/lib/pq
Used by adding this to the top of main.go :
import _ "github.com/lib/pq"
Not used directly in the code. Underscore tells Go that it's importing it for
its side effects, not because you need to use it.

Remember to add a .env file at the root with contents below. Ther reason
being that this is a local database and as such there's no SSL certificates:
DB_URL="postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/chirpy?sslmode=disable"
Then run:
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
Then call godotenv.Load() at the beginning of main() to load the .env file
into the environment variables.
Then you can use os.Getenv to get the DB_URL from the environment.
